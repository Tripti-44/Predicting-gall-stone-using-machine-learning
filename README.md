# Predicting-gall-stone-using-machine-learning
A machine learning approach for early prediction of gall stone using medical parameters like CRP, Vitamin D, Obesity, VFA and more.

This repository contains my project on **predicting gallstones** using machine learning models.  
The notebook is quite large (>50 MB), so GitHub cannot render a preview.  

👉 You can open and run the notebook directly in **Google Colab**:
